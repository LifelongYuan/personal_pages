abstract: "This work presents the application of reinforcement
learning to improve the performance of a highly dynamic hopping
system with a parallel mechanism. In the proposed framework, we introduce a
simplified serial configuration for the parallel design to avoid
directly simulating parallel structure during the training. A
torque-level conversion is designed to deal with the parallel-serial conversion to handle the sim-to-real issue."
